main features that will benefit them.

### Job search engine by GitHub user.

Our first feature is a job search engine that uses the user's GitHub profile to find job openings that match their profile. The search engine analyzes the user's repositories and programming languages, providing a personalized experience and better matching to job offers.

### Feedback with AI based on user experience.

In the second feature, we have implemented AI-based feeback and user experience. We make use of the OpenAI API to generate a feedback based on the information provided by the user through a form. This feedback provides an overview of the user experience and also offers tips for improvement.
